int score = 80; 					//primitive variable declaration by stating variable type,name and assigning a value

String result; 						//class creation named result

if (score == 80) { 					//conditional statement evaluating if the value of score is equivlant to 80. 
	result = "You passed!";  			// String result value is " You passed!"
} else if (score > 80) { 				//conditional statement evaluating if the value of score is greater than 80.
	result = "You did great!";			//String result value is " You did great!"
} else { 						//conditional statement evaluating if the above statements are false.
	result = "You did not pass. Try again!";	//String result value is " You did not pass. Try again!"
}

System.out.println(result);				//The value of result prints out to the terminal


The code above prints onto the terminal one of three conditions, based on the value of score.
